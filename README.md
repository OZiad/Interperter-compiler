# Interperter-compiler (Work In Progress)

This repository contains my implementation of an interpreter and compiler for the Lox language, developed from scratch. The project involves building both a tree-walk interpreter and a bytecode virtual machine for Lox.

The first implementation is in Java and then the next iteration will be in C++ with further optimizations

The scanner uses two-character lookahead to efficiently parse multi-character tokens and handle complex syntax.
